CSC1034: Assessment 2
=====================
Here is my simple contact application for CSC1034 Assessment 2.

When opening my csv file to check if the data is stored there please open the file in note pad, not excel as excel
destoys the leading zeros for the phone numbers. 

Assumptions made whilst making this program:
--------------------------------------------

1. When adding a new contact, I have assumed users will:
    
    i) Input the first and last name, with capitals, of the contact being added when asked.
    
    ii) Input only the street address, with capitals, when asked.
    
    iii) Input a phone number consisting of only numbers when asked.
    
    iv) Input a birthday date in the form ##/##/####.

2.  When finding a specific contact, I have assumed users will:

    i) Input the first and last name, with capitals, when using a name to search for a contact.
    
    ii) Input only the street address, with capitals, when using a address to search for a contact.
    
    iii) Input numbers only when using a phone number to search for a contact.
    
    iv) Input a birthday date in the form ##/##/#### when using a birthday to search for a contact.

3.

4. I have also assumed that no contacts will have the same name, street address, phone number or birthday.
